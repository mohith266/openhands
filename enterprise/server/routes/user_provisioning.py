"""
Admin endpoint for provisioning new users directly into an organization.

This is a privileged operation: it bypasses the normal sign-up flow
(email verification, TOS acceptance, OAuth IDP round-trip) and creates a
ready-to-use account on behalf of an org admin. Access is gated by the
``PROVISION_USER`` permission, which is granted only to ``owner`` and
``admin`` roles (see ``server.auth.authorization``).

Flow (POST ``/api/organizations/provision-user``):

1. Resolve the target org from the ``X-Org-Id`` header (validated against
   the caller's memberships by ``require_permission``).
2. Create the user in Keycloak (realm configured by
   ``KEYCLOAK_REALM_NAME``), pre-verifying the email and setting a
   non-temporary password.
3. Request an offline refresh token for the new user via ROPC and store
   it via ``TokenManager.store_offline_token`` so the account can be used
   for backend operations (e.g. SDK calls) immediately.
4. Create the OpenHands user record (mirroring the ``keycloak_callback``
   shape), but with ``email_verified=True``, ``accepted_tos=now()``, and
   ``user_consents_to_analytics=True`` — no UI round-trips required.
5. Set up a LiteLLM integration for the user in the target org and add
   them as a member (default role ``member``).
6. Mint an API key bound to the target org and return it to the caller.

The caller receives the email, password (generated if not supplied) and
API key in a single response. On failure after the Keycloak user is
created, the Keycloak user is best-effort cleaned up to keep the
identity space tidy.

**Partial-cleanup gap.** Steps 3 and 4 are sequenced so the offline
token is stored before the OpenHands user row is created. That mirrors
the production OAuth flow (``keycloak_offline_callback`` stores the
token before any ``UserStore`` interaction) and keeps the unwind
surface small: if ``UserStore.create_user`` raises, the Keycloak user
is removed by ``_cleanup_keycloak_user`` and the orphaned offline
token row is harmless — it is keyed by a Keycloak ``sub`` that no
longer exists, so it cannot be used to authenticate. The inverse
ordering (user-first) would leak the *entire* OpenHands cascade
(user + personal org + default settings + owner member row) instead
of a single encrypted token blob, which is strictly worse. We accept
the harmless token row as a known partial-cleanup gap; periodic
``OfflineTokenStore`` reconciliation (if/when added) can sweep them.
